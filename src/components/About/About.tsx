        Hi I'm a Front-End Developer from Poland. I finished art school with a
        diploma of Compuer Graphics. Initially my passion was computer graphics.
        Over time, however, I found a passion in programming. Before starting my
        studies, I was self-taught for 2 years. Now I'm trying to develop
        towards Full-Stack Developer. Programming is my passion and I love it.
      </p>

        I am also interested in 2D and 3D computer graphics, film editing and
        computer games. I love mountain climbing and traveling around the world.
        I also really like working on the gym to take care of my health and
        fitness.
